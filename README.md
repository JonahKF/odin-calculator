Calculator made for the final project in The Odin Project's Foundations course.

Still very messy - I haven't looked at other solutions as of writing,
and I have the feeling that the btn definitions in particular
could be simplified with DOM methods.

Remaining extra credit tasks are:
 - Backspace button
 - Keyboard input support
